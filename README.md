# TDD Tic Tac Toe 

This is a practice project to apply SOLID design principles and TDD. I'll create a simple console tic tac toe game where players will pass the controller back and forth to play the game.

## Requirements

* Display the board
* Enter coordinates for moves
* Switch back and forth between X and O
* Determine the winner or tie
